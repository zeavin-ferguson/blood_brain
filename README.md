# blood_brain

The goal of this project was two-fold. First, we wanted to determine how similar blood and brain gene expression profiles are both in response to ethanol exposure and irrespective to treatment. The second goal was to determine if blood signatures could predict treatement group (CIE alcohol dependent, or air-exposed non-dependent). Please refer to the manuscript for more details.
